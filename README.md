# Selenium-Project

In this project you can observe full Selenium framework written in Java using .properties files as well as some libraries like Junit, Logback and Hamcrest. 
Some patterns I used in this project:
  Page Object Pattern, 
  Factory class - for generating random new user or using existing one
  User and gender Model classes - using Builder class for user
  
The are 2 simple test at that time which tests Login and Reigstration functionality
